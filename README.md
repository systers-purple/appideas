List ideas for projects we can collaborate on

1. Community site
Something like Basecamp, but without the focus of "coding for customers". More like a family management site. What components might it have - calendar? member page with photos and profiles? map with pins where everyone is located? announcements, blogs, forum, notifications etc? Could start for just us, with just one component

2. Something for older people
A UI with larger fonts, bigger buttons, text to voice, etc. An app that provides relevance for that population... time to take your pill, time to check in with somebody, "remember when" of the day (could be old quotes, pics from old covers of magazines, war stories, etc), puzzles...

3. A localized buy/sell/trade site/app
Craigslist must be the ugliest, most successful website I know of. A smaller, prettier version of that - maybe with a pinterest look, I'm not sure.

4. Check on/keep up with/emergency help with aging parents
An app to help keep track of aging parents' details: their bank info, doctor info, close friends phone numbers, daily schedules, medicines, etc. Easy to use and not creepy-feeling. 

5. Menopause symptom tracker: what works? When will it be over? How uncomfortable is too uncomfortable?

6. Find that factory: Something that tracks codes and brand names back to factories by scanning them in the store, to increase a shopper's ability to vote with their dollar about sustainably/ethically sourced goods.
